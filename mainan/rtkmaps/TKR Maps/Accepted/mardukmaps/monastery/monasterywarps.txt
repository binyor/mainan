//any map with the statue of the stone girl with a yellow-ish square in front of her
//warps back to the spot in the first map with the stone girl surrounded by the yellow stones
//so each wing of the monastery has a warp back to entrance.
//I have sents as room10 and boss as room11 as usual, both the warps for these are outside the room
//near the door in the previous room.
//
//room0 is the entrance (outside area before the actual instance in wow.)
//this is the classic/vanilla version of scarlet monastery.
//room1-4 is graveyard. 
//room5 is library
//room6-7 is armory
//room8-9 is cathedral
//room10 (sents) is part of graveyard, where the boss was in the bottom of the crypt there
//room11 (boss) is the room in cathedral that whitemane? would come out of after mograine got killed
//
//not sure if you're into multiple monsters in one place but
//113 for room1-4,10
//224 for room5
//220 for room6-7
//220 & 224 in room 8-9
//
//boss could be 248 or 249
//or both with a mechanic like whitemane and mograine
//starts as 248, when 248 dies (corpse remains), 249 appears
//249 gets below 20% hp he casts revive and heals 248 & 249 to full
//then you fight 248 and 249 at once
